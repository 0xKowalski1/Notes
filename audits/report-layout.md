### Disclaimer

I have exerted every effort to identify as many vulnerabilities as possible within the allocated time period. However, I do not bear responsibility for the findings detailed in this document. It's important to note that a security audit does not serve as an endorsement of the underlying protocol. This audit was conducted within a specific timeframe, and the review focused exclusively on the security features of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

## Risk Classification

### Overview

Risk classification for Web3 security findings involves evaluating the potential impact and likelihood of each vulnerability. This process helps in prioritizing responses based on the severity of the risk posed to the system.

### Severity Levels

The severity of a finding is determined by assessing its impact and likelihood:

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

The combination of impact and likelihood helps in assigning a precise severity level to each finding, ensuring that the most serious vulnerabilities are prioritized and addressed swiftly to maintain the integrity and security of the system.

Additionally, informational findings may be noted in this report to shed light on non-critical issues or good practices. They offer context and detail that can help improve system understanding and security posture, even though they don't represent immediate threats.
