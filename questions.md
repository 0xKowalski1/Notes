# Questions
A series of questions I asked myself while learning web 3 security.

# What are fee on transfer tokens?
Tokens where a percentage of the token are taken as a fee on every transfer, this creates a deflationary effect. more transfers = lower total supply

# What are rebasing tokens?
Rebasing tokens automatically adjust their total supply to align with a target price; if the actual price is 5% too high, each user's balance increases by 5%, and if 5% too low, each user's balance decreases by 5%, aiming for price stability.

# What is ERC777?
A attempt to create an improved version of ERC20 (Hooks, multiowner, potentially improved security, backwards compatable with ERC20)

# Escrowed tokens?
Held in contract/non transferable until specific criteria is met
